			<h1>Lab 5: - Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab's challenge was working with javascript and a partner, and linking it to html</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>No problems, besides getting my photo to show up. Which is unfortunate because my Jetta is so precious to me. I also did not have any actual photos of my car, just my car with tickets. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It was interesting to get my javascript linked to my html, but it has been relatively smooth so far. Also the truth is that I am currently carless, as it technically belongs to my brother. He decided to take it back, and then a week later the motor stopped working </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> This page! And below is the output of my JavaScript. </p>
