		<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure</h1>
		<p>The purpose of this lab was to build onto the local file structure that I already had and add index.html files</p>
		<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>I could not figure out for the longest time why my screen looks so different until I remembered I am on a Mac. Then I struggled to stylize my page and change the size of my photo. I also had to do this without a partner because my partner dropped out of the class so it took me a really long time to do this lab.</p>
