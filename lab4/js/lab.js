// How to Play Rock, Paper, Scissors, (shoot!)
  //Start with 2 players 
    //each player close fist and rest over palm 
  //Hit palm with fist, on a beat, 4x. On each beat players will say the same words, and have synchronized movements
    //On the first beat, both player will say Rock
    //On the second beat, both players will say Paper
    //On the third beat, both players will say Scissors
    //On the 4th beat both players will say shoot 
  //On the 4th beat, both players will say Shoot and simultaneously decide & make the hand motion for either rock, paper, or scissors
    //The rock hand motion is a closed fist 
    //The paper hand motion is a flat palm 
    //The scissors hand motion is a horizontal peace sign 
  //The selected motion will decide who wins that round
    //The rock hand motion beats scissors
      //The rock hand motion bangs gently on the hand that chose scissors
    //The scissors motion beats paper
     //The scissors hand motion will pretend to “cut” the paper 
    //The paper beats rock
     //The paper hand motion will envelope the rock hand motion 
  //If players draw the same hand motion, that round is a draw. Players may decide to play rounds of three to decide the ultimate winner.
