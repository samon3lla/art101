			<h1>  Lab 4 - Coding a Psuedotask and Problem-Solving </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to psuedocode tasks, and to practice for actual coding .</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For some reason, uploading my photos is still not working, but for the most part this lab is very straightforward </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I put a lot of energy into this lab! I sat for a really long time writing out my paragraphs and working through the material. I do wish I had done this early but here I am.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					This website, my psuedocode, and everything you see is my results~
					<h3>How to Do Clown Makeup Like Me: </h3> 
						<p> start by assessing how you feel; this usually dictates my makeup for the day. I also assess my gender. am I feeling dysphoric (usually yes)? do I like my face today? do I feel out of control? do I want to look scary, am I sad, am I silly and giddy? 
						clown makeup is like a meditation for me and can be for you too; it usually helps me feel more grounded, comfortable in my body, and to process my feelings. it is also gender-affirming!
						start with your base, get a primer with a good grip. apply all over your face and let dry
							e.l.f has good and cheap primers at CVS
						for more surface area, glue down your eyebrows 
							this step is more complicated, watch a youtube video 
								make sure that you clean up residue glue around your brows and that everything is dried down (use a blow dryer on cool) before moving on 
						take your L.A. girl white foundation and put one pump on your hand. apply with a wet beauty blender, a brush, or your fingers. then blend until its no longer streaky. i like to repeat this step until the white is built up and not opaque. i only put it on my face, not my neck or ears 
							you can use any color or brand, i usually use white and L.A. girl because it is cheap and good
								you can also use skin toned foundation, but you will want a cream base so that the powder eyeshadow you will use later on has something to grab onto, and is more pigmented 
						take loose translucent powder, and apply generously. i use the flat side of a beauty bender and pack it on make sure that the powder is white or sheer and doesnt have a tint. 
							let it set for at least 5 minutes, then wipe away with a fluffy brush
						now for the awesomes. i like to start with my eyes. this is where your vibe assignment comes in,,the shapes you create with your eyes will dictate the vibe that you give out into the world. 
							i like to take the eyeshadow all the way up to where my eyebrows would be, it could be pointed or rounded, in the shape of a wing up to you. play with multiple colors on the lid, i usually take colors that will compliment the outfit im wearing
							apply eyeshadow to underneath your eye, play with different colors and shapes. 
							shape ideas: circles, half moons, sharp curves, wings, downturned wings stars, spikes, spirals, follow the natural shapes of your face too
								keep in mind how you will add eyeliner later on and how this will interact with your eyeshadow 
						eyeshadow easily turns into contour at this point. apply an eyeshadow color to the shadows and valleys of your face (under your cheekbones, jawline, nose, eyebrow bone, cupids bow, etc) and play with shapes here too! 
							reminder that the white foundation will take away all definition in your face 
						add a cute little clown nose; i usually do an oval, but it can be any shape
						clown lips! 
							i usually add two circles with eyeshadow to the corners of my lips, and lines that curve upwards or downwards that essentially “stretch” the smile 
							i have a very prominent cupid’s bow so i will usually create two parallel spikes that start at the top of my lips and extend to my nose 
							typically, i will do all of this and overline my lips with black lipstick to create this long smile, but i also like to play with shapes and colors here too! 
						blush!!!! two big circles on your cheeks, i usually use pink and red in the center 
						EYELINER!!! usually i like to do harlequin patterns, diamonds, stars, spikes, or lines. make sure you set your eyeliner with translucent powder
						eyebrows optional, depends on the look you are doing. sometimes i like to add small dots, or really skinny eyebrows 
						mascara and lashes optional, if i have time i like to add some lash strips to my bottom lashes 
						NOW GO OUT INTO THE WOLRD LOOKING AWESOME!

					<h3>How To Play Rock! Paper! Scissors!</h3>
						<p>Start with 2 players 
							- each player close fist and rest over palm -
						Hit palm with fist, on a beat, 4x. On each beat players will say the same words, and have synchronized movements
							- On the first beat, both player will say Rock -
							- On the second beat, both players will say Paper -\
							- On the third beat, both players will say Scissors - 
							
							On the 4th beat both players will say shoot

						On the 4th beat, both players will say Shoot and simultaneously decide & make the hand motion for either rock, paper, or scissors
							
							The rock hand motion is a closed fist 
							
							The paper hand motion is a flat palm 
							
							The scissors hand motion is a horizontal peace sign 
						
						The selected motion will decide who wins that round
							
							The rock hand motion beats scissors
								
								The rock hand motion bangs gently on the hand that chose scissors
							
							The scissors motion beats paper
								
								The scissors hand motion will pretend to “cut” the paper 
							
							The paper beats rock
								
								The paper hand motion will envelope the rock hand motion 
						
						If players draw the same hand motion, that round is a draw. Players may decide to play rounds of three to decide the ultimate winner.
